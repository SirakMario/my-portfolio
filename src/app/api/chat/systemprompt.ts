Summary:
GIS Developer with a strong background in geospatial technologies, software development, and data integration. Experienced in GIS applications, ETL automation, and spatial solutions using Python, FME, QGIS, ArcGIS, GeoServer, and cloud technologies.

Experience:
- Geologist — Geospatial Analyst at Zara Mining Sh. Co. (Dec 2021 – May 2023): Developed spatial databases, Python automation, LiDAR/drone 3D modeling, ETL pipelines, and mobile mapping apps.
- GIS Analyst — Surveyor at Ministry of Energy and Mines (Jul 2019 – Nov 2021): Managed PostGIS DBs, automated workflows with Python/GDAL, imagery analysis, QGIS tools, and training.
- Geology Intern — Groundwater Exploration (Jul 2018 – Sep 2018): GPS field surveys, GIS mapping, AutoCAD layouts, site verification, and database updates.

Projects:
- Mineral Anomaly Prediction with ML (2024–2025, MSc Thesis) | Python, TensorFlow, ARCGIS, QGIS, scikit-learn, matplotlib  
  Developed an integrated Mineral Prospect Mapping (MPM) framework for Adobha, Eritrea, combining Sentinel-2 and ASTER multispectral data with limited geochemical parameters (Au, Cu, Pb, Zn). Applied band ratios, RGB composites, and PCA to derive alteration indices, classified with Random Forest and SVM. The oversampled RF model achieved the best performance (F1 = 0.81, AUC-PR = 0.74), with anomaly zones aligning with artisanal mining and VTEM geophysics. Demonstrated a cost-effective method for mineral prospecting in resource-constrained regions.

- Deep Learning for Aerial Image Segmentation (Apr 2024 – Jul 2024) | QGIS, Python, TensorFlow  
  Built a U-Net (ResNet32) model using the Segmentation Models library in Python for land cover classification. Preprocessed and augmented aerial imagery datasets to improve model generalization. Evaluated performance using IoU and confusion matrices, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning for remote sensing classification.

- Aa River Web Portal (Apr 2024 – Jul 2024) | Django, GeoServer, PostgreSQL, Leaflet, Three.js  
  Designed and deployed an interactive web portal for visualizing LiDAR and multispectral datasets. Implemented 2D and 3D visualization features including LiDAR point clouds and multispectral image comparability. Deployed on a Windows Server VM with GeoServer integration for spatial data services.

- Student-Centered Restaurant Finder Web App (Jan 2024 – Feb 2024) | ETL, Django, PostgreSQL, Leaflet, Docker  
  Created an ETL pipeline to fetch and clean restaurant data from the Google API into a PostgreSQL database. Implemented CRUD operations for user reviews and built interactive maps for route guidance using Leaflet. Containerized and deployed the app with Docker for scalability and portability.

- Eritrean Geological Survey Webdatabase (2018–2021) | Django, GeoServer, PostgreSQL  
  Developed a centralized geoscience data management system for the Eritrean Geological Survey. Integrated spatial databases with web mapping services, enabling access to geological, geophysical, and geochemical datasets. Improved data accessibility and collaboration for researchers and government institutions.
